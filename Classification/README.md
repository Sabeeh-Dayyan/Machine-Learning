# **Classification Models in Machine Learning**

This directory contains the implementation of various **classification algorithms** using Python. All the models are trained and tested using the dataset `Social_Network_Ads.csv`.

---

## üìÇ **Directory Structure**
The classification algorithms are structured as follows:

| #  | Code File | Algorithm |
|----|----------|------------|
| 1  | `1_logistic_regression.py` | Logistic Regression |
| 2  | `2_k_nearest_neighbors.py` | K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) |
| 3  | `3_support_vector_machine.py` | Support Vector Machine (SVM) |
| 4  | `4_kernel_svm.py` | Kernel SVM |
| 5  | `5_naive_bayes.py` | Na√Øve Bayes |
| 6  | `6_decision_tree_classification.py` | Decision Tree Classification |
| 7  | `7_random_forest_classification.py` | Random Forest Classification |

## üìù **Description of Algorithms**
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Logistic Regression**
- A statistical model that predicts binary outcomes.
- File: `1_logistic_regression.py`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Classifies a new data point based on the majority vote of its neighbors.
- File: `2_k_nearest_neighbors.py`

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- Finds the optimal hyperplane for classification.
- File: `3_support_vector_machine.py`

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Kernel SVM**
- An advanced version of SVM that applies kernel tricks for non-linearly separable data.
- File: `4_kernel_svm.py`

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Na√Øve Bayes**
- A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes‚Äô Theorem.
- File: `5_naive_bayes.py`

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Decision Tree Classification**
- A tree-based model that splits the dataset into subsets using feature conditions.
